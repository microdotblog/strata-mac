import Foundation
import OSLog

/// A logger that emits signposts and log events to the system logging stream.
///
/// ``PerformanceLogger`` creates Logger and OSSignposter instances with the subsystem and category provided.
///
/// The data provided by this logger is best examined in Instruments. To use Instruments to profile tests in Xcode select the
/// tests tab (Command-6), right click on the test (or group of tests), and pick Profile from the popup menu.
/// When Instruments starts pick the Logging profiling template then the Record button to start the profiling session.
/// The `os_log` and `os_signpost` rows will fill up with data captured from the test being profile. You can expand those
/// to pick the specific `subsystem` and `category` the `PerformanceLogger` was configured to use.
/// Above the details pane at the bottom along the left hand side of the window there is a popup control labeled either `List`
/// or `Summary`. By picking `Summary: Intervals` you can see how many of each measured interval took place, the
/// total execution time, the average execution time, etc.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```swift
///
/// let perfLogger = PerformanceLogger(subsytem: Blackbird.loggingSubsystem, category: "Database.Core")
/// // ...
/// let signpostState = perLogger.begin(signpost: .execute, message: "Some explanatory text")
/// // ...
/// // perfLogger.end(state: signpostState)
///
/// }
/// ```
