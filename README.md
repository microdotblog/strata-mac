# Strata for Mac

This is the version of Strata just for macOS. For the iOS and Android version, see the `microdotblog/strata` repository.

Strata uses a Micro.blog account and the Micro.blog API to manage private notes. Sync between computers and mobile devices is end-to-end encrypted using a secret key.
